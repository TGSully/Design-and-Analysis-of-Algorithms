# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Term project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms course in 2017

## Code 
Contains a program which implements Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and 
Heap Sort algorithms.  Each algorithm sorts an array of varying sizes 
(ns <= n <= nf).  After sorting, the measured runtime is calculated for each 
iteration. Then the average is taken of these execution times and
saved in an output file to be plotted.

## Data
Resulting CSV values to be plotted
